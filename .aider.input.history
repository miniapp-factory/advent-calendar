+Code the following app
+```
+Create a mini-game similar to Battleship with a completely covered grid. The position of the ships should not be visible: the player only discovers what is there when they click on a square.
+Include at least 3 ships of different sizes.
+When the player clicks on a square:
+If there is a ship, display a green rectangle with a black X on it.
+If there is no ship, show a blue X.
+When all parts of a ship have been hit, the green rectangles for that ship turn into red dots to indicate that it has been destroyed.
+When all three ships have been destroyed, show the words “YOU WIN” in the center of the screen.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
